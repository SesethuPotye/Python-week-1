# What this moduele will be focusing on

* Finding Inspiration for Python projects.
* Planning your Python Projects
* Create and implement User stories and Use cases
* Define and collate project requirements and program architecture
* Designing a project Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* Packaging and publishing Python projects


# Finding Inspiration

* The first thing you do when you embark on a new projectendeavor for enjoyment or practice, the initial puzzle to solve is: What should the program accomplish?
* first step is to seek inspiration from what you love ,such as hobbies or a problem you would want to solve.
* Your workplace can also serve as a wellspring of ideas also checking if are there aspects of your job that could benefit from automation?
* Also Reflecting on task that can be done through automation

# User Stories
* They depict small scenarios from a user's perspective, these stories should emphasize the user's goal and motivation rather than the application itself.
* User stories are brief, simple, and informal, perfect for jotting down on index cards.
* They typically follow the format "As a [user/role], I want [goal] so that [reason/benefit]".

# Example of a user stoy
* User stories focus on the who, what, and why of a task or goal

* NB: when writing user stories, focus on the user's goals and reasons, rather than specific interface details or implementation methods.
*  ## Use Cases
*  Use cases typically include a title, an actor (a user or system), and a scenario that describes how a goal is achieved.
 
* scenario can be written as a paragraph or a list of steps in simple language
* For example, a use case may involve a digest recipient reading tweets on a specific Twitter trend by opening the email, clicking on the trend link, and accessing the corresponding Twitter page.
* use cases cover the who, what, and how of achieving that goal. They complement each other rather than compete.

# Project Requirements

*  Functional requirements describe what the application should or should not do and are written as sentences starting with "the application must" or "the application shall."

* non-functional requirements describe how the application should accomplish its tasks. They focus on qualities like maintainability, reliability, and usability
