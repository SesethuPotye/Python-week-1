*  PYTHON

*  PYTHON : is a dynamically tpyes, high, interpreted programming language which has easy syntax.
 pyton used for: do almost everything that one can imagine, used for game, development, automation, data anaysis.
 
HOW TO ACCES PYTHON

command prompt, open a terminal and type "Python". Once opened, there are three greater-than symbols indicating that the prompt is ready to accept a line of Python code.
To proceed, type in the command "import this" now. The "import" command is used to fetch a module that can be utilized, and "this" is the name of the module we're importing
Creating and running a simple Python statement, “Hello world!”
name your file: ipynb used for naming your file as an extention in jupyter
python variable: they are created when you are assigning a value to
to access the stored file on python use the "cd" command, which means change directory.on comand prompt

# VARIABLES IN PYTHON(variables in Python,whole numbers; floats, Booleans,)

* A variable is something that is can change, are containers for storing data values.

  
# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(x)
# print(y)

to create a vaiavle you need to declear by assigning a value to it

# DATA TYPES

* # interger(int)
* the value can be negative
* but can not be a decimal number
* eg. 1, 4, -7 etc

# FLOAT

* Any number that is a decimal
* can be a negative decimal
* 12.1, -4.3, 1.2

# STRING

* Collaction of different characters 
* Declared by """, etc
* eg "name", "1" etc"

# BOOLEANS

* which is ture or false
