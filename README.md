In a Jupyter Notebook, new cells can be created by holding down the shift key and pressing enter multiple times.
 To enter Python code, click inside the cell to enter edit mode and start typing.
 To run the code, hold down shift and press enter.

*  PYTHON

*  PYTHON : is a dynamically tpyes, high, interpreted programming language which has easy syntax.
 pyton used for: do almost everything that one can imagine, used for game, development, automation, data anaysis.
 
HOW TO ACCES PYTHON

command prompt, open a terminal and type "Python". Once opened, there are three greater-than symbols indicating that the prompt is ready to accept a line of Python code.
To proceed, type in the command "import this" now. The "import" command is used to fetch a module that can be utilized, and "this" is the name of the module we're importing
Creating and running a simple Python statement, “Hello world!”
name your file: ipynb used for naming your file as an extention in jupyter
python variable: they are created when you are assigning a value to
to access the stored file on python use the "cd" command, which means change directory.on comand prompt

# VARIABLES IN PYTHON(variables in Python,whole numbers; floats, Booleans,)
* A variable is something that is can change, are containers for storing data values.
  
 Creating Variables
* Python has no command for declaring a variable.
* A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

e.g
# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(x)
# print(y)

to create a variable you need to declear by assigning a value to it

# DATA TYPES

* # interger(int)
* the value can be negative
* but can not be a decimal number
* eg. 1, 4, -7 etc

# FLOAT

* Any number that is a decimal
* can be a negative decimal
* 12.1, -4.3, 1.2

# STRING

* Collaction of different characters 
* Declared by """, etc
* eg "name", "1" etc"

# BOOLEANS

* which is ture or false

DATA STRUCTURES

list []


OPERATORS
# Arithmetic Operators:

+: Addition
-: Subtraction
*: Multiplication
/: Division (floating-point division)
//: Floor Division (integer division)
%: Modulus (remainder)
**: Exponentiation

# Comparison Operators:

==: Equal to
!=: Not equal to
<: Less than
>: Greater than
<=: Less than or equal to
>=: Greater than or equal to

# Logical Operators:

and: Logical AND
or: Logical OR
not: Logical NOT
Assignment Operators:

=: Assign value
+=: Add and assign
-=: Subtract and assign
*=: Multiply and assign
/=: Divide and assign
%=: Modulus and assign
//=: Floor division and assign
**=: Exponentiation and assign
&=: Bitwise AND and assign
|=: Bitwise OR and assign
^=: Bitwise XOR and assign
<<=: Left shift and assign
>>=: Right shift and assign

# Membership Operators:

in: Checks if an element exists in a sequence
not in: Checks if an element does not exist in a sequence

# functions

* A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
* You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
* A function can return data as a result.
  
# Creating a Function
In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
e.g def my_function():

Calling a Function
To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
e.g def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()

# Arguments
* Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
* Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.
* You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.
  
example:
def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")

parameters or arguments:
* information that are passed into a function.
* A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
* An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

# Number of Arguments
* By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments.
* Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.
  
  example
* def my_function(fname, lname):
 * print(fname + " " + lname)

*my_function("Emil", "Refsnes")

# classes and objects

Create a Class
* use the keyword class:
* example
* class MyClass:
 * x = 5

# Create Object
* class MyClass:
  8x = 5

* p1 = MyClass()
* print(p1.x)
