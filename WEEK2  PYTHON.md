1. BASIC FUNCTION
   
* A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
* Functions are composed of a name and parameters, which are denoted by the def statement.
* A function can return data as a result.

# Creating a Function
In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:

example:

     def my_function():
        print("Hello from a function")
# CALLING A FUNCTION
To call a function we use the function name fallowed by the parenthesis:

example

    def my_function():
      print("Hello from a function")
    my_function()
    
other example that takes 2 paramaters and an operation

    def performOperation( num, num2, operation):
     if operation == "sum "
         return num1 + num2
     if operation == "multiply"
         return num1 * num2
     performOperation(2,3 "sum"")
     
ARGUMENTS
* Information can be passed into functions as arguments
* Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses
* Aguments can be separated with a comma if you want to add many of them
* Arguments are often shortened to args in Python documentations.

example of a function with 1 argument

    def my_function(fname)
      print(fname + "Refsenses"
    my_function("Emil")
    my_function("Tobias")
    my_function("Linus")
    
named parameters eg, adding a key word "message" to our function

       def performOperation(num1, num2, operation= "sum",  message="Default message"):
           print(message)
           if operation == "sum":
             return num1 + num2
           if operation == "multiply":
             return num1 * num2

    performOperation(2,3, message= "A new message!", operation="multiply")
    A new message!
    
# rules when using key word arguments
* they must come after the positional arguments
* The order of the first two arguments is important and cannot be changed. However
* You can also send arguments with the key = value syntax.
* after these mandatory arguments, the keyword arguments can be in any order. 

# Arbitrary Arguments, *args
(is used befor the parameter name in a function def when  you dont know how many arguments that will be passed into your function)

    def performOperation(*args):
        print(args)
    perfomOperations(1,2,3)
    (1,2,3)

# Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs

* If you do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function, add two asterisk: ** before the parameter name in the function definition.
* This way the function will receive a dictionary of arguments, and can access the items
* accordingly:
* keyword arguments have keys and values and can be passed in any order.

example

    def my_function(**kid):
      print("His last name is " + kid["lname"])

    my_function(fname = "Tobias", lname = "Refsnes")

#  Variables and Scope

Function Scope
* *args and **kwargs were used to print out the arguments passed into a function. This allowed us to see a tuple and dictionary of the passed arguments.

# "locals" function.

* another method that allows us to access all the variables within a Python function without any asterisks.
* local are defined inside the function.

# Globals()
* A variable created in the main body of the python code is a global variable and beongs to the global scope,
* Global variables are available from within any scope,global and local
A variable created outside of a function is global and can be used by anyone

# Variables as Functions
* Variables and functions both have names and data associated with them.
*  for functions, this data includes information about required parameters and the lines of instruction to be executed.
*  In Python, a function is represented as an object.
  
# Viewing Function Data With  __code__

* "code" attribute of Python function objects can be used to confirm that functions are just variables in Python.

Text Processing in Python
* There are two text processing operations, and a function that can make the text lowercase, remove punctuation, new lines, and words that are three characters or less. It can also remove long words

# Lambda Functions
* A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
* These are a way to represent a function without giving it a variable name.
* small function can be defined using the lambda keyword.
* example, lambda x: x + 3 is a lambda function that takes a single parameter x and returns x plus three

# Syntax
# lambda arguments : expression
* lambda functions can come handy when you need to pass a function as an argument to another python function ,such as the sorted function that sorts a list of values.

* Reason we use lambda
power of lambda is better shown when you use thm as an anonymous function inside another function.

2. CLASSES AND OBJECTS FUNDAMENTALS
* Python Classes/Objects: Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
* Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
* Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

# CREATING A PARENT CLASS
* Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:

# Create a Child Class
* To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class:
![image](https://github.com/SesethuPotye/Python-week-1/assets/162969678/3f67892a-514a-4f4f-8e2c-70f74fc39c66)
* Note: Use the pass keyword when you do not want to add any other properties or methods to the class.






# Create a Class
* To create a class, use the keyword class:

# The __init__() Function[Instance Attributes]
* To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
* All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
* Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:

![image](https://github.com/SesethuPotye/Python-week-1/assets/162969678/ee869759-9fae-4c04-bae9-73719fbcee31)

# Add the __init__() function to the Student class:

# Use the super() Function
* Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:
 ![image](https://github.com/SesethuPotye/Python-week-1/assets/162969678/47a55ae9-d9c3-47fa-ae1d-6e6ddd28fad3)

# Add Properties

## In the example below, the year 2019 should be a variable, and passed into the Student class when creating student objects. To do so, add another parameter in the __init__() function:

# The __str__() Function[Static Attributes]
* The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
* If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:

  # The string representation of an object WITHOUT the __str__() function:

# The string representation of an object WITH the __str__() function:

# Object Methods
* Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.
![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

# The self Parameter



# HANDLING ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS
*  exceptions are determined during runtime and can be retried.
*  errors cannot be retried  
*  Python errors and exceptions ultimately stem from a class called the base exception
