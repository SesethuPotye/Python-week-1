# FUNCTIONS
* A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
* Functions are composed of a name and parameters, which are denoted by the def statement.
* A function can return data as a result.

# Creating a Function
In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:

example:

     def my_function():
        print("Hello from a function")
